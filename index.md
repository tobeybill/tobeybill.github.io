This project compares the positive and negative sentiments present in firm 10-Ks reported in the 2022 year with returns after the reports are filed. The sentiment measurements achieved are shown with returns seen over the 2 days following filing and then from day 3 through 10. A correlation measure is calculated and visualized in the form of a scatterplot
