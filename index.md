_**[Comparing Firm 10-K Sentiment to Company Stock Returns](report/report.md)**_

This project compares the positive and negative sentiments present in firm 10-Ks reported in the 2022 year with returns after the reports are filed. The sentiment measurements achieved are shown with returns seen over the 2 days following filing and then from day 3 through 10. A correlation measure is calculated and visualized in the form of a scatterplot.

_**[CEO Treatment Impact on Shareholder Confidence](https://tobeybill.github.io/dreamteam/)**_

This project analyzes data on CEO treatment and how it affects the shareholder confidence in the companies these executives lead. The treatment metrics focused on are 1) CEO compensation and 2) forced CEO turnover. To measure shareholder confidence, we look at the companyâ€™s stock price performance in a given year and/or after a given turnover date. We also conduct a dismissal event study in order to uncover correlation between firm performance and CEO dismissal (unexpected or not).
